# Finance Portfolio Starter

This is a minimalist, fast portfolio for FP&A/FBP/Management Accounting projects.

## Deploy in 3–5 minutes
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `portfolio` (public).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch**. Choose `main` and `/ (root)`. Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`.
   - Alternative: drag-drop the folder into https://app.netlify.com/ for instant hosting.

## Add your content
- Edit `index.html` and replace “Your Name”, email, and bullets.
- Update `projects.html` card text and add/remove projects.
- Duplicate `assets/Project-Case-Study-Template.html` to create more case studies (move the copy into the root and link it).
- Add your **Excel/Power BI/SQL** files to a `files/` folder and link them from each case study. If proprietary, publish screenshots + a redacted sample dataset instead.

## Power BI note
If you use **Publish to web**, anything becomes public. For safer demos, share screenshots or use synthetic data. Never publish confidential material.

## Accessibility & SEO
- Semantic HTML, alt-less layout, responsive and light-weight.
- Update `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` in each file.
- Add your LinkedIn in the navbar if desired.
